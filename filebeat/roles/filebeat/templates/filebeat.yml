######################## Filebeat Configuration ############################

# This file is a full configuration example documenting all non-deprecated
# options in comments. For a shorter configuration example, that contains only
# the most common options, please see filebeat.yml in the same directory.
#
# You can find the full configuration reference here:
# https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/index.html

#========================= Filebeat global options ============================

# Registry data path. If a relative path is used, it is considered relative to the
# data path.
# filebeat.registry.path: ${path.data}/registry

# The permissions mask to apply on registry data, and meta files. The default
# value is 0600.  Must be a valid Unix-style file permissions mask expressed in
# octal notation.  This option is not supported on Windows.
#filebeat.registry.file_permissions: 0600

# The timeout value that controls when registry entries are written to disk
# (flushed). When an unwritten update exceeds this value, it triggers a write
# to disk. When flush is set to 0s, the registry is written to disk after each
# batch of events has been published successfully. The default value is 0s.
#filebeat.registry.flush: 0s


# Starting with Filebeat 7.0, the registry uses a new directory format to store
# Filebeat state. After you upgrade, Filebeat will automatically migrate a 6.x
# registry file to use the new directory format. If you changed
# filebeat.registry.path while upgrading, set filebeat.registry.migrate_file to
# point to the old registry file.
#filebeat.registry.migrate_file: ${path.data}/registry

# By default Ingest pipelines are not updated if a pipeline with the same ID
# already exists. If this option is enabled Filebeat overwrites pipelines
# everytime a new Elasticsearch connection is established.
#filebeat.overwrite_pipelines: false

# How long filebeat waits on shutdown for the publisher to finish.
# Default is 0, not waiting.
#filebeat.shutdown_timeout: 0

# Enable filebeat config reloading
filebeat.config:
  inputs:
    enabled: true
    path: inputs.d/*.yml

    #reload.period: 10s

#================================ General ======================================

# The name of the shipper that publishes the network data. It can be used to group
# all the transactions sent by a single shipper in the web interface.
# If this options is not defined, the hostname is used.
#name:

# The tags of the shipper are included in their own field with each
# transaction published. Tags make it easy to group servers by different
# logical properties.
#tags: ["service-X", "web-tier"]

# Optional fields that you can specify to add additional information to the
# output. Fields can be scalar values, arrays, dictionaries, or any nested
# combination of these.
#fields:
#  env: staging

# If this option is set to true, the custom fields are stored as top-level
# fields in the output document instead of being grouped under a fields
# sub-dictionary. Default is false.
#fields_under_root: false

# Internal queue configuration for buffering events to be published.
queue:
  # Queue type by name (default 'mem')
  # The memory queue will present all available events (up to the outputs
  # bulk_max_size) to the output, the moment the output is ready to server
  # another batch of events.
  mem:
    # Max number of events the queue can buffer.
    events: 256

    # Hints the minimum number of events stored in the queue,
    # before providing a batch of events to the outputs.
    # The default value is set to 2048.
    # A value of 0 ensures events are immediately available
    # to be sent to the outputs.
    flush.min_events: 124

    # Maximum duration after which events are available to the outputs,
    # if the number of events stored in the queue is < min_flush_events.
    flush.timeout: 1s

max_procs: 1

  max_message_bytes: 5000000

  # The ACK reliability level required from broker. 0=no response, 1=wait for

#================================ HTTP Endpoint ======================================
# Each beat can expose internal metrics through a HTTP endpoint. For security
# reasons the endpoint is disabled by default. This feature is currently experimental.
# Stats can be access through http://localhost:5066/stats . For pretty JSON output
# append ?pretty to the URL.

# cluster.  This requires xpack monitoring to be enabled in Elasticsearch.  The
# reporting is disabled by default.

# Set to true to enable the monitoring reporter.
monitoring.enabled: true
# Uncomment to send the metrics to Elasticsearch. Most settings from the
# Elasticsearch output are accepted here as well.
# Note that the settings should point to your Elasticsearch *monitoring* cluster.
# Any setting that is not set is automatically inherited from the Elasticsearch
# output configuration, so if you have the Elasticsearch output configured such
# that it is pointing to your Elasticsearch monitoring cluster, you can simply
# uncomment the following line.
monitoring.elasticsearch:

  # Array of hosts to connect to.
  # Scheme and port can be left out and will be set to the default (http and 9200)
